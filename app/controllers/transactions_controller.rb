      Filters and returns a transaction list. Only payment transactions are
      returned.
      The proposed query params are only example, many more are possible. If
      the query params string gets too big, please encode the query
      as JSON and POST it to /transactions/search.json.

      The query should be a json object of the form
      { "q": { "foo_eq": "abc", "bar_lteq": "12" } }
      but I haven't yet found how to represent that in the current API
      description. The same operators as in GET /transactions.json are
      possible.
